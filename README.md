## How-Different-Public-Expenditure-Programs-Affect-Unemployment

The relationship between public expenditure, particularly unemployment benefits, and labor
market dynamics has been the focus of extensive academic inquiry. This paper aims to
explore how unemployment benefits and other forms of public expenditure affect the
unemployment rate, analyzed at a country level, through the computation of a linear
regression model, from which we will be able to extract meaningful insights to develop an
analysis to potentially guide policymakers in developing public expenditure policies that
maximize households' welfare while minimizing market distortions and negative externalities
caused by these expenditures.

## How to run

In order to properly run the code of the file, Python and Jupyter Notebooks are required. 
The file should be opened as a Jupyter Markdown. Moreover, the dataframes can be found in 
my personal website for download. Make sure to substitute the default paths when reading the 
excel files for your own ones. Regarding the packages, the required ones are `pandas`, 
`numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels`.

## The Data
